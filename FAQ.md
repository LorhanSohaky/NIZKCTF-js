## FAQ

If you want to learn more about our Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) platform, read this paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05844.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05844.pdf)

**1 - Why do I need to login with my GitHub account?**

Among the technologies we use to make our platform auditable by anyone, GitHub is one of them. You can make an exclusive account for the CTF (it’s very fast, so fast when registering on ctfd), if you wish, or use your personal account. The only permission we need is access to your public repos. For the login process to run as expected, make sure you are already logged in to GitHub before registering.

**2 - [IMPORTANT] Where is the "team secret" stored?**

The team secret is stored in the “localStorage” of your browser. Remember that if you will use another box or another browser on the competition’s day. **We recommend you to copy/save the team-secrets at the exact moment** you register the team.

**3 - How much time does it take for the points to appear in the scoreboard after a correct flag is submitted?**

If you get the message "Flag found, submitted", just wait a while until the bot merge your flag (deploy time). This can take up to 1 minute.

**4 - When do the nicknames appear on the members list (after left click on the team name)?**

Nicknames appear when the player submits any correct flag.

**5 - I received an error when sending a flag, returning a link to the Pull Request. What to do?**

It means that the flag is incorrect. Try harder! :)

**6 -  Can you guys provide the source code of the platform and web-client?**

No problem, everything is open source. Take a look at:
-   Platform source: [https://github.com/pwn2winctf/NIZKCTF](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/NIZKCTF)
-   Web-client source: [https://github.com/pwn2winctf/NIZKCTF-js/](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/NIZKCTF-js/)
